# 5 Hard Lessons from My First Year Freelancing

Last year, I left my full-time job to freelance as a web developer. Here's what I learned.

## 1. Pricing is Hard (But Critical)

My biggest mistake? Undercharging for my first few projects.

I thought low prices would help me land clients. Instead, I attracted clients who didn't value my work.

**Lesson**: Price based on value, not hours. Good clients pay for results, not time.

## 2. Contracts Aren't Optional

Three months in, a client asked for "just a few small changes" that turned into a complete redesign.

Without a contract defining scope, I had no leverage.

**Lesson**: Every project needs a signed contract. No exceptions.

## 3. Marketing Never Stops

I made the mistake of stopping marketing once I had projects lined up.

When those projects ended, I had zero pipeline.

**Lesson**: Spend 20% of your time on marketing, even when you're busy.

## 4. Saying No is a Superpower

Not every project is worth taking. Some clients are:
- Disrespectful of your time
- Unclear about what they want
- Unwilling to pay fair rates

**Lesson**: Turning down bad-fit clients creates space for great ones.

## 5. Build Systems Early

I wasted so much time on admin tasks because I didn't set up systems from day one.

**What I should have automated:**
- Invoicing
- Contract signing
- Project onboarding
- Time tracking

**Lesson**: Invest in tools and processes early. Your future self will thank you.

## Final Thoughts

Freelancing is challenging but incredibly rewarding. These lessons cost me time and money, but they made me a better professional.

If you're starting your own freelance journey, I hope these insights save you some of the pain I experienced!
