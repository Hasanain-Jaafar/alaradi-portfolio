# Why I'm Building My Portfolio in Public

Three months ago, I decided to rebuild my portfolio from scratch. Instead of working in private, I chose to share the entire process publicly.

## The Decision

Building in public felt scary at first. What if people judged my early designs? What if I made mistakes?

But here's what I realized: **everyone starts somewhere**.

## What I've Learned

### 1. Feedback is Invaluable

When I shared my initial designs on Twitter, I received thoughtful feedback that saved me weeks of work. People pointed out usability issues I'd never have caught on my own.

### 2. Accountability Keeps You Moving

Knowing that people were following my progress kept me motivated. On days when I felt stuck, the encouraging comments reminded me why I started.

### 3. You Help Others by Sharing

Several people reached out saying my posts inspired them to start their own projects. That's incredible!

## The Results

Today, my portfolio is nearly complete. More importantly, I've:

- Connected with amazing people in the community
- Learned more than I would have alone
- Built confidence in my abilities

## My Advice

If you're considering building in public, just start. You don't need to share everything—just the parts you're comfortable with.

**The support you'll receive will surprise you.**
